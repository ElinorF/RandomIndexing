This program takes a text input and processes it using Random Indexing which is a dimension reduction method and computational framework for Distributional semantics. It basically represents each word in the text with a vector containing statistics about that word. The statistics are based on which contexts the word was found in. Random Indexing works better with a larger text mass. 

Input text file Standard.txt and output file RandomIndexed.txt can be found in the folder called Data.
